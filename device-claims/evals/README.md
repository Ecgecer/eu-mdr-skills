# Evals

Seven cases. Three are **false-positive controls** (`02`, `03`, `07`) — they fail if
the skill invents findings or applies a provision outside its scope. A claims-review
skill that only tests for catches will happily flag everything.

## Running

```
claude plugin eval device-claims
```

**Note:** `claude plugin eval` is currently early-access gated. On an account without
it enabled the command exits with `plugin eval is currently in early access` and runs
nothing. These cases have therefore been validated by running the prompts against the
skill manually rather than through the harness — see the repo README.

To run one manually: give a fresh agent the SKILL.md plus the three reference files,
paste the case `prompt`, and check the output against that case's grader text.

## The case that matters most

`03-hwg11-item-scope`. HWG § 11(1)'s closing sentence limits devices to nos. 7, 8, 9,
11 and 12. Citing no. 2 (professional endorsements) against a medical device is wrong,
and it is the error a model is most likely to make, because no. 2 reads like it should
apply and the restriction lives in a single sentence at the end of a long list.
